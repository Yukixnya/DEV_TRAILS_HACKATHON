# GigShield

## Problem Statement

Gig delivery workers in India depend on **daily or weekly earnings** to sustain their livelihood. However, their ability to work is often disrupted by **external factors** such as:

- Heavy rainfall
- Flooding
- Extreme heat
- Curfews or strikes
- Market shutdowns

When these disruptions occur, workers **lose income even though the loss is not their fault**.

### Limitations of Traditional Insurance

Traditional insurance products:

- Are claim-based
- Require manual documentation
- Have slow claim processing

Gig workers need a **simple, fast, and automated income protection system**.

**GigShield** solves this problem using **AI-powered parametric insurance** that automatically triggers payouts when disruption conditions are met.

## Application Workflow

### Registration

The system must allow gig workers to register using:

- Name
- Phone Number
- City
- Delivery platform
- Weekly income

A user profile is created upon successful registration.

---

### AI Risk Assessment

The system must:

- Analyze location-based risk factors:
  - Weather history
  - Flood frequency
  - Heatwaves
  - Curfew/Strike frequency
- Calculate a risk score
- Recommend an appropriate weekly insurance plan

#### Example

| Risk Level | Weekly Premium |
|---|---|
| Low | ₹40 |
| Medium | ₹60 |
| High | ₹80 |

---

### Plan Recommendation

The system recommends weekly coverage plans.

#### Example

| Plan | Weekly Premium | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| Plan A | ₹60/week | Up to ₹2,000 |
| Plan B | ₹80/week | Up to ₹3,000 |

User selects a plan.

---

### Policy Activation

User must be able to:

- View recommended plans
- Select weekly coverage
- Activate policy using:
  - UPI
  - Wallet (simulated)

Policy becomes active for 7 days.

---

### Real-Time Distributed Monitoring

The platform continuously monitors:

- Rainfall
- Temperature
- Flood alerts
- Curfew or strikes

Using external APIs.

---

### Automated Claim Trigger

When disruption thresholds are met:

1. System detects event
2. Checks affected location
3. Validates active policies
4. Automatically creates a claim

No manual claim submission is required.

#### Auto Claim Workflow

```

---

### Fraud Detection

The system verifies:

- User GPS location
- Delivery activity data (simulated)
- Duplicate claims

Fraud prevention includes:

- Location mismatch detection
- Multiple claims filtering
- Policy validity checks

---

### Instant Payout

Once a claim is validated:

- System initiates payout
- Money is transferred via:
  - UPI
  - Simulated payment gateway

User receives a confirmation notification.

---

## Weekly Premium Model & Parametric Triggers

| Risk Level | Weekly Premium | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| Low | ₹40 | Up to ₹1,500 |
| Medium | ₹60 | Up to ₹2,000 |
| High | ₹80 | Up to ₹3,000 |

Parametric triggers are pre-defined thresholds tied to external data sources. When a threshold is crossed (e.g., rainfall > 70mm, temperature > 44°C, curfew detected), the system automatically initiates a claim — no worker action needed.

---

## AI/ML Integration Workflow

Three core AI/ML models are built using Python libraries: **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost**.

---

### 1. Risk Prediction Model (Premium Calculation)

Calculates how risky a worker's specific area is before they purchase a policy.

**Input:**
- Rainfall history
- Flood risk
- Historical traffic congestion
- AQI

**Output:**
- Risk Score (e.g., `0.72`)
- Dynamic risk factor added to the base premium
- Real-time premium adjustment for hyperlocal risk zones

#### Premium Purchase Flow (Risk Based)

### 2. Income Loss Estimation Model

Once a parametric trigger activates, this model calculates how much income the worker lost due to disruption.

**Workflow:**

- Tracks normal delivery efficiency vs disrupted efficiency
- Example:
  - Normal: 3 deliveries/hour × ₹40
  - Disrupted: 1 delivery/hour
- Calculates the exact income lost during disruption periods
- Issues proportionate payouts

Additionally uses routing APIs (e.g., TomTom) to detect:

- Drop in delivery distance
- Route time inefficiency
- Reduction in deliveries per hour

---

### 3. Fraud Detection Model

Protects the insurance engine from false claims using anomaly detection.

**Techniques:** Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM

**Workflow:**

- Scans for suspicious activities before approving claims
- Detects:
  - GPS mismatches (e.g., worker in Pune but event in Mumbai)
  - Duplicate claim attempts
  - Unusual claim patterns
- Prevents fraudulent payouts through:
  - Location validation
  - Pattern anomaly detection
  - Policy consistency checks

## Why Mobile-First

Mobile apps consistently outperform websites in engagement, performance, and user retention.

### Key Advantages

- Push notifications drive real-time engagement — unlike websites, apps reach users directly on their lock screen
- Native device access (GPS, camera, biometrics) enables richer, context-aware features that websites can't match
- Installed presence on a user's home screen reduces friction and builds habitual use
- Partial offline functionality ensures continuity even with poor connectivity
- Deeper personalization through device behaviour leads to higher satisfaction and retention

### Mobile App vs. Website — At a Glance

| Factor | Mobile App | Website |
|---|---|---|
| Push Notifications | Direct, timely alerts to users | Email or browser only |
| Device Integration | GPS, camera, biometrics, sensors | Limited hardware access |
| Performance | Native speed, smooth interactions | Browser-dependent latency |
| Offline Access | Works without internet (partially) | Requires constant connectivity |
| User Retention | Always visible on home screen | Users must seek it out |
| Personalization | Deep behavior & device data | Limited customization |

### Bottom Line

A mobile app gives direct access to users, richer device capabilities, and a persistent presence on their devices. For a platform that depends on real-time alerts and engagement, it is the stronger long-term investment.

##  Adversarial Defense & Anti-Spoofing Strategy

GigShield is designed to withstand coordinated fraud attacks such as GPS spoofing, fake claims, and organized fraud rings.


We assume attackers may:

- Fake GPS location to appear in high-risk zones  
- Trigger false claims during disruptions  
- Coordinate across multiple accounts (fraud ring)  
- Exploit automated payout systems  

So What We Are Doing To Prevent This ?

---

## Multi-Layer Fraud Defense System

Instead of relying on a single check (like GPS), GigShield uses **multi-layer verification**.


### 1️. GPS Spoofing Detection

We do NOT trust raw GPS blindly.

#### Techniques Used:

- **Speed Consistency Check**
  - Detect unrealistic jumps  
  - Example: Mumbai → Pune in 5 minutes →  Fraud  

- **Route Validation (TomTom)**
  - Compare GPS path with real road network  
  - If user appears off-road → suspicious  

- **Drift Pattern Analysis**
  - Fake GPS often shows straight-line or static patterns  

- **Device Integrity Signals (Optional)**
  - Detect emulator / rooted device behavior  

---

### 2️. Delivery Activity Verification

Fraudsters fake presence, but **not real work**.

#### We gonna validate:

- Deliveries per hour  
- Route movement  
- Distance traveled  

#### Example:

- Claimed: Active for 6 hours  
- Actual movement: 0.5 km  

→ Fake activity  

---

### 3️. Cross-Signal Validation (Most Powerful)

A disruption must be **visible across multiple signals**:

| Signal | Expected |
|---|---|
| Weather | Heavy rain |
| Traffic (TomTom) | High congestion |
| Delivery Activity | Drop in deliveries |

If only one signal is triggered → **NO payout**

---

### 4. Fraud Ring Detection (Critical)

We detect coordinated attacks across users.

#### Indicators:

- Multiple users:
  - Same GPS pattern  
  - Same timestamps  
  - Same movement behavior  

- Cluster anomaly detection:
  - 100+ users claiming from identical coordinates  

#### Method we are using:

- Graph-based clustering  
- Isolation Forest (group anomaly detection)  

→ Entire cluster flagged for review  

---

### 5️. Location Consistency Check

We verify:

- Registration city vs claim location  
- Historical movement patterns  

#### Example:

- User always works in Mumbai  
- Suddenly claims in Delhi  

→ Suspicious  

---

### 6️. Policy Abuse Protection

- One claim per event per user  
- Cooldown between claims  
- Policy must be active BEFORE event
  
---

### 7️. Risk-Based Claim Approval

Not all claims are treated equally.

| Risk Level | Action |
|---|---|
| Low Risk | Instant payout |
| Medium Risk | Delayed auto-check |
| High Risk | Manual review |

---

## AI-Powered Fraud Detection

We use anomaly detection models:

- Isolation Forest  
- One-Class SVM  

### Features:

- GPS consistency  
- Movement patterns  
- Claim frequency  
- Zone mismatch  
- Group behavior  


## Protecting Honest Workers

We avoid false positives using:

- Multi-signal validation (not single trigger)  
- Confidence scoring instead of hard rejection  
- Partial payouts if uncertainty exists  
- Manual review for edge cases  


## Final Defense Philosophy

GigShield follows:

> "Trust signals, not claims."

- No manual claim submission  
- No single-point failure (like GPS)  
- Multi-layer validation  
- AI + rule-based hybrid system
